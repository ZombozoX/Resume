<h1>Coding Class Projects</h1>
<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Kid%20C/Code%20Central/Code%20Central(Sublime).html" target="_blank">First Project</a>
<p>This assignment was to make a copy of one of the instructor's website. I must have contain: an image, a hover, a button that changes if the pointer is over it and when you click it goes to another page in the same tab, along with a sound.</p><br>
<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Kid%20C/Button/index.html" target="_blank">Switch</a>
<p>A simple project I did, I just had to make a switch. Click it, it turns blue. Click it again, it turns gray. And I'll like to point out it has smooth animation when it's clicked.</p><br>
<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Kid%20C/Button/button.htm" target="_blank">Button</a>
<p>A unfinished, forgotten project. It was suppose to give a message, if you clicked it.</p><br>
<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Kid%20C/iFrame/iFrame.htm" target="_blank">iFrame</a>
<p>A side project where I make an add box with a website linked to it, and that link is presented before in a small box.</p><br>
<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Kid%20C/Forgot%20my%20flashdrive/Index.html" target="_blank">Final draft of my Big Project</a>
<p>This is one of biggest projects I've done. It's all of the things I've learned in Code Central into one website. It's still being built and I hope it'll look professional's website.</p><br>
