	<h1>Coding Class Projects</h1>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/Code%20Central/Code%20Central(Sublime).html" target="_blank">First Project</a>
		<p>This assignment was to make a copy of one of the instructor's website. I must have contain: an image, a hover, a button that changes if the pointer is over it and when you click it goes to another page in the same tab, along with a sound.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/Button/index.html">Switch</a>
		<p>A simple project I did, I just had to make a switch. Click it, it turns blue. Click it again, it turns gray. And I'll like to point out it has smooth animation when it's clicked.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/Button/button.htm" target="_blank">Button</a>
		<p>A unfinished, forgotten project. It was suppose to give a message, if you clicked it.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Camemron%20C/iFrame/iFrame.htm" target="_blank">iFrame</a>
		<p>A side project where I make an add box with a website linked to it, and that link is presented before in a small box.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/Forgot%20my%20flashdrive/Index.html" target="_blank">Final draft of my Big Project</a>
		<p>This is one of biggest projects I've done. It's all of the things I've learned in Code Central into one website. It's still being built and I hope it'll look professional's website.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/vocabSite/index.html" target="_blank">Biology Vocabulary Site</a>
		<p>I started this website with a new instructor in Code Central, Victor, cool guy. I was taught how to separate my HTML, Java, and CSS into three different files that link altogether and still function like a single website.<img src="Victor.jpg" height="320px" width="320px"><br>(This is the guy.)</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/CSS%20Projects/challenge002.htm" target="_blank">Menu X Animation</a>
		<p>My first CSS project, I was assigned to make a menu symbol to move the bars and make an X symbol, then later was told to do an after image on making a triangle and other shapes. But I moved on to another project.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/CSS%20Projects/X%20animation.htm" target="_blank">Menu Animation (Color)</a>
		<p>I was supposed to make the previous project change color, but I also added a moving square that changes color.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/CSS%20Projects/EHH.htm" target="_blank">Random Color Generator</a>
		<p>A project where I just had the background color change everytime you click it, then I added a box that showed the hex code with pandas beside it.</p><br>
	<a href="file://readyshare/USB_Storage/_StudentProjects/Cameron%20Chapin/CSS%20Projects/Panda%20Color.htm" target="_blank">Panda Color Generator</a>
		<p>This is the same as Random Color Generator, except in the background it is the frame around the tranparent panda image.</p><br>
